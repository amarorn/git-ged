The whole intent of this gist is subsumed by this awesome-looking gem:

* https://rubygems.org/gems/cli

The following things don't appear to be supported by cli yet (as of 24 Jan. 2012):

1. multiple short options like "-rf"
2. git-like concatenated option/value combinations like "-Spattern"
3. any kind of sub-command support (not supported by this gist either)

Other than that, cli is everything I wanted and more.
