Structure
- repo layout
- library
- commands

Bootstrapping
-------------
- use pickled_optparse for required options
- move init's optparse initialization into init.rb

- use pwd and arg in init.rb to get full pathname to new git-ged repo and print in output
- make init.rb use grit to initialize (note: .../.git is what it expects for non-bare)
- add --bare option

- move layout.txt down under lib/git-ged/data (leaving a symlink behind at root)
- create licenses subdir with data licenses by short-name
- create templates area that refs/heads/master can be populated from during "git ged init"

- create lib/git-ged/ingest.rb that copies a GEDCOM in and assigns permaname (refs/local/gedcoms)
- ingest one of Hannah's small GEDCOMs
- ingest one of Hannah's full GEDCOMs
- get rib-git-ged plugin working

- create living filter pipe for filtering GEDCOMs
- create lib/git-ged/import.rb that copies a GEDCOM from refs/{local=>heads}/gedcoms with living filter
- create person/family permaname generation strategies (_UUID or name/birth/death, parent permanames)
- create entity permaname+state link logic
- create lib/git-ged/import-person.rb that copies refs/heads/{gedcoms=>persons} (with living filter)
- create lib/git-ged/import-family.rb that copies refs/heads/{gedcoms=>families} (with living filter)
- import one of Hannah's GEDCOMs

- populate person/family => gedcom permaname+state links
- create ingest logic for dealing with the second ingest/import cycle on the same GEDCOM
  - pick default person/family permaname generation logic based on whether the _UUIDs match up
  - create local/gedcoms history based on 

Ideas
-----
- patch gem-man to read README{,.md} in lieu of any explicit manpage (gem man rib)
